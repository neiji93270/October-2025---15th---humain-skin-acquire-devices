//in order to preserve the fist model rows, we need to use a treshold again.
//this treshold is common. we will use 10^15. this is due to
//to common log function utility. next, we will use the grace of ghe rows 
//to get computer vision albedo formulas. this is common to
//a well known level of integrals if we can use rougness. notice that this os 
//not ui/ux security.



//tonget ui/ux security, wr can use containers if
//it deals with cipher isos. so the isos could be tru'cated
//by using treshold 5,7 times. this is really ill defined.
